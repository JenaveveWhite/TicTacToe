# Overview

This program is a simple Tic Tac Toe game. It is a two player game where you enter a row and column number separated by a space to mark your spot. Player X goes first, then player O. 
It is written in C#. The purpose of this game was to help me further develop my C# skills and become more familiar with the language. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
